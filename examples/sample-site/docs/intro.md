# Cookie Consent Demo

This demo Docusaurus site showcases how to integrate and configure `docusaurus-plugin-cookie-consent`.

The example site is intentionally small so you can focus on the cookie consent experience—open the home page to see the toast banner and visit the Cookie Preference Demo section to explore programmatic interactions.

## What you will learn

- Enable the plugin from `docusaurus.config.ts`
- Customize the copy, buttons, layout, and categories
- Query consent state from React components using the provided hook

Continue with the rest of the docs for step-by-step guidance and reference material.
